<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>
  Welcome to SNAP&rsquo;s data API, your gateway to seamless connectivity
  between our backend data and your front-end applications. With this versatile
  tool, you can access and manipulate the wealth of data we offer, and tailor it
  to suit your unique needs. You can also integrate the API into your own
  applications or scripts using the documentation outlined below for each of the
  endpoints offered. Whether you&rsquo;re looking to highlight features of the
  data or to harness our data for custom analyses, this API is your one-stop
  shop for all of SNAP&rsquo;s data offerings. For further details and
  inquiries, don&rsquo;t hesitate to reach out to us at
  uaf-snap-data-tools@alaska.edu. We&rsquo;re here to make climate data easier
  to access and understand!

<h4>Rasdaman raster database</h4>
<p>
  This tool uses the
  <a href="http://www.rasdaman.org/">rasdaman</a> array database management
  system. This technology enables our team to store, analyze and visualize the
  5+ TB of climate data that are presented through this interface. We wish to
  thank the rasdaman project and team for their inspiration and support, and for
  providing this important innovation in data technology.
