<h2>CMIP6 Fire Weather Indices</h2>

 <p>
  This endpoint provides access to fire weather indices derived from 
  bias-corrected CMIP6 daily data (for historical and future periods)
  and from the ERA5 reanalysis (for the historical period). The dataset 
  spans 1980&ndash;2100 with daily temporal resolution from April 1 to 
  October 31 of each year, at 0.25 x 0.25 degree spatial resolution. The
   spatial domain is limited to the North American boreal ecoregion, 
  as defined by <a href="https://doi.org/10.1641/0006-3568(2001)051[0933:TEOTWA]2.0.CO;2">
    Olson et al. (2001)</a>.
  
  Variables are those used in the Canadian Forest Fire Danger Rating System (CFFDRS) 
  Canadian Forest Fire Weather Index (FWI) System. Read more about CFFDRS and FWI <a href="https://cwfis.cfs.nrcan.gc.ca/background/summary/fdr">here</a>.

    </tr>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
     <td>Buildup Index</td>
     <td><code>bui</code></td>
     <td>Numeric rating of the total amount of fuel available for combustion. 
        It is based on the <code>dmc</code> and the <code>dc</code>.
    </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Drought Code</td>
      <td><code>dc</code></td>
      <td>Numeric rating of the average moisture content of deep, compact organic layers. 
        This code is a useful indicator of seasonal drought effects on forest fuels and the 
        amount of smoldering in deep duff layers and large logs.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Duff Moisture Code</td>
      <td><code>dmc</code></td>
      <td>Numeric rating of the average moisture content of loosely compacted organic 
        layers of moderate depth. This code gives an indication of fuel consumption in moderate 
        duff layers and medium-size woody material.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Fine Fuel Moisture Code</td>
      <td><code>ffmc</code></td>
      <td>Numeric rating of the moisture content of litter and other cured fine fuels. 
        This code is an indicator of the relative ease of ignition and the flammability 
        of fine fuel.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Fire Weather Index</td>
      <td><code>fwi</code></td>
      <td>Numeric rating of fire intensity. It is based on the <code>isi</code> and the <code>bui</code>, 
        and is used as a general index of fire danger throughout the forested areas of Canada and Alaska.
    </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Initial Spread Index</td>
      <td><code>isi</code></td>
      <td>Numeric rating of the expected rate of fire spread. It is based on wind speed and <code>ffmc</code>. 
        Like the rest of the FWI system components, <code>isi</code> does not take fuel type into account. 
        Actual spread rates vary between fuel types at the same <code>isi</code>.
