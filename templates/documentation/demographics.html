<h2>Demographics</h2>

<p>
  The endpoints here provide access to demographic data derived from the 2020 US Census Demographics and 
  Housing Characteristics File (DHC), the 2019&ndash;2023 US Census American Community Survey (ACS) 5-year dataset,
   the 2023 CDC PLACES dataset, and the 2017&ndash;2021 CDC Non-Medical Factor Measures dataset. 
   Data is returned for individual Alaskan communities, and also includes contextual data for the state of
    Alaska and the United States.
