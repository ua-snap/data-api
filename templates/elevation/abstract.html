<h3>Elevation Data</h3>
<p>These data are for use in the Climate Impact Reports tool. Currently the service endpoints query ASTER GDEM elevation data for Alaska and Western Canada. Each query fetches three values: minimum, maximum, and mean elevations derived from corresponding interpolations used to resample the source data from 30 m spatial resolution to 1 km. This technique is used to assure elevation fidelity between the original and downsampled data.</p>
<h4>Service Endpoints</h4>
<ul>
    <li><a href="/elevation/point">Point Query</a>: Fetch values for a single geographic point.</li>
    <li><a href="/elevation/area">Polygon Query</a>: Fetch zonal statistic values for a single polygon (HUC, protected area, fire management unit, etc.).</li>
</ul>
