# maybe make a function for each dataset?
# make the 5 different coroutines and gather them in fire_api?

# I must be misinterpreting this here but I just can't read around it.
# bit confused here about making an HTTP query to the API itself.
# To me that means calling a session.request with the URL to the
# API (confusing because it seems unnecessary?)

# Also confusing is the endpoint being endpoint/lat/lon. Why are lat/lon/
# in the URL this way? Is there some way to configure such that
# e.g. landcover/65/-135 can be parsed so that the first numeric value is
# taken to be the lat, and second value to be the lon? From the reading
# I was thinking the API endpoint would need to look something like
# ?lat=65&lon=-135

# also confused because the landcover data is in GeoServer - why are
# we going to query it via from within this python API instead?
# Confusing because example in API gdoc has sample WMS query for this very thing
